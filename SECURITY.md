# Security & Bug Reports

## Reporting a Bug or Issue

Found something broken? Please [open an issue](https://github.com/Torutesu/shortcutai/issues) with:

- What happened and what you expected
- Steps to reproduce
- Your macOS version

## Reporting a Security Concern

If you find something security-related (like API keys being mishandled or data being sent somewhere it shouldn't), please open a private security report through the repository's Security tab instead of opening a public issue.

- You'll get a response within a few days.
- Your report stays confidential.
- You'll be credited in the fix if you want.

## How ShortcutAI handles your data

- Your API keys are stored locally on your Mac.
- Text is sent directly to your chosen AI provider — nothing passes through our servers.
- No analytics, no tracking, no telemetry.
