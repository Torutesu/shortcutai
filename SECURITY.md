# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Reporting any potential vulnerabilities is strongly encouraged.

If you suspect a vulnerability, please take the following steps:

1. **Contact** the maintainer via DM on [X (@elmoidev)](https://x.com/elmoidev).
2. **Include** a description of the potential vulnerability and steps to reproduce the issue, if possible. The more information you can provide, the quicker we can address the problem.
3. **Maintain confidentiality** about the vulnerability while we work on a fix. Please refrain from exploiting the vulnerability or revealing the problem to others.

### What to expect

- You will get a response within a few business days.
- Your report will be treated with full confidentiality.
- Your contribution will be acknowledged in the fix, if you'd like.
- You are welcome to publicly discuss your findings once users have had reasonable time to apply the patch.
- We will not pursue any legal action as long as the vulnerability is not exploited.
